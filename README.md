# Rust BKTree

A simple BKTree written in rust. It can be used as a library in your own code or as an API.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### API

If you would like to use the api, you can get started by making a get request to the following link.

https://bktree-api.dev.benlafferty.me/words?query=test&distance=2&limit=0

This will make a request to the API, and give words within a "edit" distance of 2 with no limit. It auto-completes from the standard unix dictonary.

What the paramaters do is as followed.

```bash
Query: The word that you want auto-complete or suggestions for.
Distance: The amount of potential 'edits' to a word that the API will return.
Limit: If you only want x amount of words returned form the API instead of all of them.
```

### Library

Currently, the library is not published on on crates.io, but you can import it as a Github repository if you would like to use it.

Add the following to your Cargo.toml file.

```toml
[dependencies]
bktree-rs = { git = https://github.com/tempor1s/bktree-rs }
```
